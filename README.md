# Bank vault holdup webapp

*Bank vault holdup* is a game where you have to guess a secret pass to open the bank vault and get the reward! There is no hint, you just have to follow your intuition.

The app has been released at this address: <a href="https://bankvault.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">bankvault.herokuapp.com</a> (the loading may take some seconds).

Let me know if some bugs appear in your browser (I know there is a font problem with IE; and the game does not work on cellphones).

I released this webapp mostly to understand how work node.js and mongodb. I deployed the app with <a href="https://www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a> and <a href="https://mlab.com" target="_blank">MongoLab</a>. Itâ€™s just a small test app, but I hope you could have some fun trying to find the password.
