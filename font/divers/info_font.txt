Segment7 font
â€” Created in 2014 by
Cedders

Strictly seven-segment (plus point) calculator display face, fixed-width and free. Other LED/LCD digital fonts may kern or include paths that are not available with seven segments in order to represent characters better. Segment7 does the best it can for upper- and lower-case Latin without compromising on the true LCD display appearance. I intended it for power meter display on a website, so the point has no width after a number.
